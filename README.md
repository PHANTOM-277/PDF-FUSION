# PDF-FUSION

PDF-FUSION is a small app developed to work around with pdf files.
It lets the user merge and split pdfs.

Key Features :
1.) Merge Several Pdf files into one Pdf file
2.) Split one Pdf file into multiple Pdf files 

The App works completely on the client side.

This is my first React project and eventhough i haven't made the styling anything special
I am quite happy with its functionality.
