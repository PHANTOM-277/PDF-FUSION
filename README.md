# PDF-FUSION

PDF-FUSION is a small app developed to work around with pdf files.
It lets the user merge and split pdfs.

Key Features :
1.) Merge Several Pdf files into one Pdf file
2.) Split one Pdf file into multiple Pdf files 

The App works completely on the client side.

Technologies Used:

React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
react-router-dom: Declarative routing for navigating within the application.
pdf-lib: Library for PDF manipulation in JavaScript.
JavaScript: Programming language for frontend logic.
CSS: Styling the user interface.
JSX: Syntax extension for JavaScript used with React.

This is my first React project and eventhough i haven't made the styling anything special
I am quite happy with its functionality.
