# PDF-FUSION

PDF-FUSION is a small app developed to work around with pdf files.
It lets the user merge and split pdfs.

Key Features :
1.) Merge Several Pdf files into one Pdf file  
2.) Split one Pdf file into multiple Pdf files 

The App works completely on the client side.

Technologies Used:

1. React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.  
2. react-router-dom: Declarative routing for navigating within the application.
3. Vite: Used Vite's React Template to manage all the libraries.
4. pdf-lib: Library for PDF manipulation in JavaScript.  
5. JavaScript: Programming language for frontend logic.  
6. CSS: Styling the user interface.  
7. JSX: Syntax extension for JavaScript used with React.  

This is my first React project and eventhough i haven't made the styling anything special
I am quite happy with its functionality.
